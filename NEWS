PopED News/Changelog

PopED 0.1.2
===========

* Updated model_prediction() to allow for creation of NONMEM datasets.  
  Useful for testing of optimized designs via PsN's (http://psn.sf.net) SSE tool, for example.

* Two new functions create_design() and create_design_space() that allow for design and design space creation without the 
  need for a model or parameter values.

* Updated the create.poped.database() function to use create_design() and create_design_space()

* Added examples for evaluation and optimization of a one-target quasi-steady-state 
  target mediated drug disposition model (TMDD) to the system.file("examples", 
  package="PopED") directory of the PopED installation.

* Added a 2-compartment, oral absorption, multiple dose example to the system.file("examples", 
  package="PopED") directory of the PopED installation.

* Updated plot_efficiency_of_windows() to allow for the plotting of the RSE of each parameter on the y-axis.

* Updated error handing for the Laplace approximation of the ED OFV.

* Fixed bug when computing FIM with only one BSV term present in model (calculation gave 
  an error).

* Fixed a bug in plot_model_predictions where an error was returned if not all time 
  values in the xt matrix were to be used for the design calculation 
  (ni is different from size(xt,2), see ?create_poped_database).

* Various small bug fixes.


PopED 0.1.1
===========

* Updated package author list

* New functionality to compute the ED OFV using the Laplace approximation.
  This can be orders of magnitude faster than the standard MC integration approach.
  See '?ed_laplace_ofv' and '?evaluate.e.ofv.fim' 

* Added a general function to compute the FIM and OFV(FIM) for all avaialbale methods in PopED.
  See '?calc_ofv_and_fim'.

* Added a general optimization algorithm 'RS_opt_gen()' that works for both D-family and 
  E-family optimization.

* Added optimization of E-family designs to 'poped_optimize()'.

* Changed distribution tests for package building 

* Fixed bug where correlations between BSV (between subject variability) terms in the model gave an 
  error when creating a PopED database

* Fixed a bug where get_rse failed when a parameter had a value of 3.


PopED 0.1.0
===========
 
* PopED has been translated to R from MATLAB and this is the initial release.
