* Added a general function to compute the FIM and OFV(FIM) for all avaialbale methods in PopED.
  See '?calc_ofv_and_fim'.

* Added a general optimization algorithm 'RS_opt_gen()' that works for both D-family and E-family
  optimization.

* Added optimization of E-family designs to 'poped_optimize()'.

* Changed distribution tests for package building 

* Fixed bug where correlations between BSV (between subject variability) terms in the model gave an 
  error when creating a PopED database
